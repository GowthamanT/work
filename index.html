                                        in my free time. I've had the fair share

                                        During my internship, I honed my skills
                                        in email template design and transformed

                                        Figma prototypes. I gained proficiency
                                        in CSS preprocessors, including Sass and
                                        Scss, which I successfully applied in my
                                        web development projects. Additionally,
                                        I became adept at HTML, CSS and JS. My
                                        internship provided valuable hands-on
                                        experience and solidified my foundation

                                        creation, crafting tailored question
                                        banks to meet specific requirements. As
                                        I delved into development projects, my
                                        curiosity led me to explore the world of
                                        Angular, where I acquired valuable
                                        skills. I also gained a foundational
                                        understanding of Spring Boot and
                                        ventured into the realm of some DevOps
                                        tools, like Jenkins. Along this exciting
                                        path, I've had the opportunity to create
                                        Angular projects for hackathons,
                                        cementing my passion for development.
